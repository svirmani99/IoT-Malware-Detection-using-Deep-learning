# IoT-Malware-Detection-using-Deep-learning
The project uses ensemble learning to detect malicious images on IoT_Malware dataset.

# Description of the Project
Dataset used: IoT_Malware
The images represents the packets that are entering the network.

The proposed model consists of different modules:
1.	Feature extraction
2.	Self attention
3.	Deep learning network
4.	Label Computation
For feature extraction, 7 CNN models are used.

# Code will be made available after the publication of the Research Paper.
